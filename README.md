# firmata_animatlab

ArbotixFirmata is a generic protocol for communicating with microcontrollers
   from software on a host computer. It is intended to work with
   any host computer software package.

I have edited this code to be used in my robotics research for communication between the Pixy cameras and Arbotix-M controllers. Code has been added in order to trasmit x, y, width and height coordinates of an object using analog.
